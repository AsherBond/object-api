    <title>Overview</title>
    <para>OpenStack Object Storage is an affordable, redundant, scalable, and dynamic storage
        service offering. The core storage system is designed to provide a safe, secure,
        automatically re-sizing and network-accessible way to store data. You can store an
        unlimited quantity of files and each file can be as large as 5 gigabytes, plus with
        large object creation, you can upload and store objects of virtually any size.
    </para>
    <para>OpenStack Object Storage allows users to store and retrieve files and content via a simple
        Web Service inteface (ReST: Representational State Transfer). There are also
        language-specific APIs that utilize the ReSTful API but make it much easier for
        developers to integrate into their applications.</para>

        <title>Intended Audience</title>
        <para>This guide is intended to assist software developers who want to develop applications
            using the OpenStack Object Storage API. It fully documents the ReST application programming
            interface (API) that allows developers to interact with the storage components of
            the OpenStack Object Storage system. To use the information provided here, you should first have a
            general understanding of the OpenStack Object Storage service and have access to an installation of
            OpenStack Object Storage. You should also be familiar with: </para>

        <para>Rackspace also provides Rackspace-supported, language-specific APIs in several popular
            programming languages. Currently, the supported APIs are C#/.NET, Java, PHP, Python,
            and Ruby. These APIs utilize the ReST API and are provided to help developers
            rapidly integrate OpenStack Object Storage support into their applications without
            needing to write at the ReST interface. Each API includes its own documentation in
            its native format. For example, the Java API includes JavaDocs and the C#/.NET API
            includes a CHM file.</para>
